## What is a cookie?
  - Cookies: are small blocks of data created by a web server while a user is browsing a website and placed on the user's computer or other device by the user's web browser

Example: 
You visit a website that allows you to select the language you view it in. You select English. 

The website then saves a cookie for you (onto your computer), so the next time you view the website, it automatically shows the website to you in English.

## What can cookies contain?
Cookies can contain pretty much any information, examples include:
  
  - time you visited a website
  - all the links you clicked on a website
  - all the items you added to your shopping cart

A cookie can only contain so much text.


## What are some types of cookies?

### Authentication Cookies:

  - commonly used by web servers to authenticate that a user is logged in and with which account.

  - Allow the user to access info w/o having to log into each page containing sensitive info.

  - The security of an authentication cookie generally depends on the security of the issuing website and the user's web browser, and on whether the cookie data is encrypted

### Tracking Cookies:

  - commonly used as ways to compile long-term records of individuals' browsing histories 
  
  â€” can be a potential privacy concern that prompted European and U.S. lawmakers to take action in 2011. 
  
  - European law requires that all websites targeting European Union member states gain "informed consent" from users before storing non-essential cookies on their device.


## Who can read your cookies?
Only the same website that saves info to a cookie can read that information.

Example:
You visit the first website that allows you to select your language and you select English.

Now if you visit a different website that allows you to select your language, your cookie will not be read by this second website. 

Only the same website that saved the cookie, can read the cookie.

## How much data can cookies contain?
Cookies could only save a limited amount of data. 

As a work-around developers decided that cookies would contain a unique ID for you instead, and then it would store all of the actual cookie data in its own system.

The cookie just serves an an identifier for you. Then it can look up your details in its own system.


## Cookies & Advirtisements
If a website you visited contains an ad, and the ad has saved a cookie to your computer, it can display this add when you look at different web-pages.

The cookie could also save info about you from the other websites as well. Then it can display ads that you are most likely to buy. 


## Who determines if a cookie is good or bad?
It is up to the creators of a website, what they do or do not store. As well as what they do with that data.
