# Responsive Design

## Responsive Web Design
Many users browse websites on their smartphones, however, web developers now need to handle visitors using large desktop screens, mice/touchpads, and keyboards, as well as relatively small mobile touchscreens.

Some websites build a completely separate mobile site and host it on its own domain (ex. m.wikipedia.org), but for now we will stick to covering CSS and HTML techniques that let you adapt a single site to various screen sizes.


## "Mobile First" Development
When developing a responsive web application, many developers adopt the Mobile First approach. This dictates that all design of a new website should center around how it will be viewed and navigated on a mobile platform. 

Only when a mobile design is perfected, will the team then use CSS to adjust the sizes and layout of elements for desktop. 

The rationale behind this approach is that it is much easier to adapt a good looking and well functioning mobile website for desktop, than to go the other way. 

In a mobile layout, an element needs to take up more screen space in order to be easy to view. In a desktop layout this is less necessary. 

If you design your website in a way that requires multiple, large elements to be visible at the same time, shriknking it to all fit on a small screen could prove more challenging.

Below are a number of ways a developer can control the layout of their website to make it more suitable for all devices.
