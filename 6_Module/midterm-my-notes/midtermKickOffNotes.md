# W05D05 - Mid-term Project Kickoff

## Pick a Project
  Our group has selected Project #4 - Decision Maker

## User Stories
  * A user story describes how users will interact with your application
  * They have the form: As a ______, I want to ______, because ______.
  * eg. As a user, I want to be able to save posts, because I want to review them later.
  * User stories can also be negated: As a _____, I shouldn't be able to ______, because _____.
  * eg. As a user, I shouldn't be able to edit other users posts, because I don't own those posts.

## User Scenarios
  * A user scenario is a syntactic alternative to user stories
  * They have the form: Given _____, when ______, then ______.
  * eg. Given that I am logged in, when I click favourite on a post, then it is added to my favourites.
  * You can also chain on an and to user stories/scenarios
  * eg. Given that I am logged in, when I click favourite on a post, then it is added to my favourites and the save icon will change to indicate success.

## ERD
  * The user stories provide you with nouns (eg. user, posts, favourites)
  * Use these nouns/entities to build out your database (ie. tables are the nouns from the stories)

## Routes
  * Once you know the resources that you'll have, write out the routes that you'll need to perform BREAD operations on those resources
  * Remember RESTful conventions (they make it much easier)

## MVP vs MVD
  * There is a concept in development of an MVP, the Minimum Viable Product
  * An MVP has just enough features to be useful to a user
  * This concept helps streamline the development process and help keep the team on target
  * For mid-terms, we want to focus on the MVD, the Minimum Viable Demo
  * If you aren't going to demo it, don't build it

## Wireframes
  * Draw out the structure of your web pages
  * This will make it much easier to build out these pages later
  * This is also a great opportunity to get input from all of the team members
  * Design matters... however you are a developer, not a designer
  * Get inspiration from websites you visit

## User Login
  * Don't do it
  * Seriously, don't do it
  * We know that you know how to register and login users

    // do this instead
    app.get('/login/:id', (req, res) => {
      // using encrypted cookies
      req.session.user_id = req.params.id;

      // or using plain-text cookies
      res.cookie('user_id', req.params.id);

      // send the user somewhere
      res.redirect('/');
    });

## Tech Choices
  * We have made all the tech choices for you
  * Back End: Node and Express
  * Front End: HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, Bootstrap

## The Mid-term Skeleton
  * Use the provided node-skeleton as a template for your project
  * This will get you up and running quickly

## SPA vs Multi-page App
  * These concepts are not mutually exclusive
  * You can choose one or the other or both

## Git
  * Use Git best practices (ask a mentor for clarification if you need it)
  * Use branches

# DO NOT CODE ON MASTER
  * I repeat, do not code on master

## Splitting up the Work
  * Horizontally - whole team working on front-end or back-end at the same time
  * Vertically - divide the work between front-end and back-end
  * Pair Programming - working together on the same tasks

## Communication
  * Make sure to communicate with your team members
  * Use Slack, iMessage, Google Hangouts, whatever... just make sure that everyone is on the same page

## Github Projects
  * Github has a built-in project board (similar to a kanban board)

## Deployment
  * Decide if you want/need to deploy your application to the cloud
  * Ask a mentor for assistance/advice if your team decides to deploy
