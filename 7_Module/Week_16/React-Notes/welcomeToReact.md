# Welcome to React - Notes

React allows us to create reusable blocks of HTML called "components", and pass in data down via someting call "props".

React facilitates the process of manipulating the DOM (document object model) with its own virtual DOM. We don't have to use selectors anymore, and we don't need to invoke specific methods to manipulate different aspects of the DOM.

Aside from all this, React is the most popular library in terms of use and employability. Although technically React is a library, many people consider it like a framework.

It has a large community and many add-ons. If you run into an issue, there is a good chance someone has an answer for you.

You can learn it in a short period of time, and React will teach you core concepts that can carry you over to the other popular frameworks.

Btut before we hop into React, we need to brush up on our JS skills.
