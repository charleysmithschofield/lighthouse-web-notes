# Client-Side JavaScript:

Now we focus on how JavaScript works in the browser and also begin to get comfortable with the fundamentals of Document Object Model (DOM) traversal and manipulation with jQuery.

JavaScript is used to create dynamic content within a webpage. Similar to Node on the server-side, client-side JavaScript is asynchronous and makes extensive use of callback functions. However, client-side JavaScript also deals with user-generated events and interacts with the DOM.

## The Three: HTML, CSS, & JS:

You will often see three terms listed together: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is important to understand the role of all three within a web page.

### HTML
HTML deals with expressing the structure of the DOM. It adds context to the content of the page.

### CSS
CSS deals with element styling, pogitioning, and basic animations. It determines the appearance of the content.

### JS
JavaScript handles behaviour, logic, dynamic content, and user interaction. It defines the behaviour of the content.
