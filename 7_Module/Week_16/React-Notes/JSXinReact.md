# JSX In React - Reading

## What is React?
A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

  * React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React
  will efficiently update and render just the right components
  when your data changes.

  * Declarative views make your code more predictable & easier
  to debug.

React has a way to manage the `state` (the current status of each view) in our application. React takes care of updating and render-
ing what we see in the browser to reflect the current state.

  * Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, and
  then compose them to make complex UIs. 

  * Since component logic is written in JS instead of templates,
  you can pass rich data through your app and keep state out of
  the DOM.

This is called encapsulation. A group of elements that can be stored
inside a component and a component cand be called by another compon-
ent.

## Template Engine
A long time ago, websites were written directly in HTML since there was no languages that could generate HTML automatically, those were the days of the static pages.

After a while, a couple of languages and syntaxes became popular and that gave rise to what became known as template engines. Popular ones like PHP, EJS, ERB and Liquid began to be used more and more.

The thing they had in common was that they were mostly HTML. The only difference was that those engines all had a special tag to execute code, to show dynamic content.

<!-- Statis HTML way -->
<ul>
  <li>1</li>
  <li>2</li>
  <li>3</li>
  <li>4</li>
  <li>5</li>
</ul>

<!-- EJS way -->
<ul>
  <% for(let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {%
    <li><%= i %></li>
    <% } %>
  </ul>

Since React will be creating HTML for us through the rendering process, we will need an easy way to create React elements.

JSX is the language that allows us to do that, and lets us declare what the user interface should look like.

It is not required to use JSX and React, but there are many reasons why we choose to JSX with React.


## React: Behind The Scenes
React.createElement

Creating a React element with JSX means defining the type of elements of element and any properties that we want to pass it. Notice how it looks a lot like HTML, but it is not HTML.

JSX:
const element= <h2 className="name">Name</h2>

The code above is run through a tool that knows how to turn JSX into JavaScript. The tool produces a JavaScript expression that creates a React element using React.createElement, as seen below:

JavaScript:
const element = React.createElement("h2", {
  className: "name"
}, "Name")


Notice that JSX uses className instead of class to define CSS classes.

Some of the properties do not map directly to HTML attributes. React is helpful with the warnings it provides. In this example, we would see Warning: Invalid DOM property 'class'. Did you mean 'className'? in the console if we use class.

The React.createElement(type, [props], [...children]) function allows us to create a hierarchy of DOM nodes. The following JSX describes a static tweet:


import React from "react";

function Tweet() {
  return (
    <article className="tweet">
      <header className="tweet__header">
        <img
          className="tweet__header-avatar"
          src="https://api.adorable.io/avatars/64/react@adorable.png"
          alt="Avatar"
        />
        <h2 className="tweet__header-name">React</h2>
      </header>
      <main className="tweet__content">
        <p>A JavaScript library for building user interfaces</p>
      </main>
      <footer className="tweet__footer">May 29th, 2013</footer>
    </article>
  );
}


To create the same elements without using JSX, we would have to write the same code seen below. This code is automatically generated by the conversion tool:

import React from "react";

function Tweet() {
  return React.createElement(
    "article",
    {
      className: "tweet"
    },
    React.createElement(
      "header",
      {
        className: "tweet__header"
      },
      React.createElement("img", {
        className: "tweet__header-avatar",
        src: "https://api.adorable.io/avatars/64/react@adorable.png",
        alt: "Avatar"
      }),
      React.createElement(
        "h2",
        {
          className: "tweet__header-name"
        },
        "React"
      )
    ),
    React.createElement(
      "main",
      {
        className: "tweet__content"
      },
      React.createElement(
        "p",
        null,
        "A JavaScript library for building user interfaces"
      )
    ),
    React.createElement(
      "footer",
      {
        className: "tweet__footer"
      },
      "May 29th, 2013"
    )
  );
}


A Tweet component is created with const tweet = <Tweet />. React requires that we always start component names with a capital letter. When JSX is being converted, it uses the case of the tag name to determine if we are describing a component of an HTML element.

  * Always start component cames with a capital letter.


## ReactDOM.render
An element can be "rendered" into any DOM node using the react-dom library. This example requires <div id="roor"></div> to be declared in the HTML. 

In the example below document.getElementById("root") in the call to ReactDOM.render is used to access the "root" DOM node. Everything inside of it will be managed by React.

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

function Tweet(props) {
  return (
    <article className="tweet">
      <header className="tweet__header">
        <img className="tweet__header-avatar" src={ props.avatar } />
        <h2 className="tweet__header-name">{ props.name }</h2>
      </header>
      <main className="tweet__content">
        <p>{ props.content }</p>
      </main>
      <footer className="tweet__footer">{ props.date }</footer>
    </article>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Tweet
    name="React"
    avatar="https://api.adorable.io/avatars/64/react@adorable.png"
    content="A JavaScript library for building user interfaces"
    date="May 29th, 2013"
  />,
  document.getElementById("root")
)

Most applications call ReactDOM.render(element, container) a single time to render the application.
