<!-- Javascript in the Browser -->


<!-- There are multiple ways to include JS, wiht some
subtle important distinctions.

Much of the client-side web development involves
the DOM. It is important to be aware of how browsers
render the DOM, its structure, and how to inspect/
manipulate it (using JS and manually for debugging).


HOW TO ADD JS TO HTML:

Video Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gd0RBdFRvF0

Watch this video tutorial that demonstrated the various
ways to add JS to HTML, including:

  - using the <script> tag (in the head or body)
  - Linking an external .js file (in the head or body)
  - Inline JS (not a good practice) -->


<!-- USING THE SCRIPT TAG:
In your HTML document you can use the tag <script> to add JS: -->

<script> 
  alert("Welcome to my website");
</script>

<!-- Generally you should try to put your JS at the bottom of the
body tag, so the rest the page can load before the JS executes-->


<!-- USING AN EXTERNAL JS SCRIPT FILE STEPS:

  1. Add a file called main.js
  2. Write your JS in that file
  3. Link your JS file at the bottom of the <body> of your HTML file:
    <script src="fileNameHere.js"></script

    * Remember:
    - we link JS with the <script> tag
    - we link CSS with the <link> tag
-->


<!-- INLINE JS (Not A Good Practice)

  Directly in your HTML you can inline JS:
-->

<div id="navigation">
  <ul>
    <li> <a onclick="alert('Welcome to my website');" href="htmlFileNameHere.html">Contact Us</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
