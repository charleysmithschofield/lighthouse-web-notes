Rubber Duck Debugging:

1. Beg, borrow, steal, buy, fabricate or otherwise obtain a rubber duck.

2. Place rubber duck on desk and inform it that you are just going to go
   over some code, if that's alright.

3. Explain to the duck what your code is supposed to do, then go into detail
   and explain your code line by line.

4. At some point you will tell the duck what you're doing next and then realise
   that is not in fact what you are actually doing.

5. The duck will sit there serenly, happy in the knowledge that it has helped
   you.
