# Binary Search - Reading

## Binary Search
Binary Search is a very common algorithm when we need to search for something in a set of ordered data. We could use binary search to efficiently search for a name in a phone book, a word in a dictionary, or just a specific number in a set of ordered numbers.

### Linear Search

  Let's say we have a list of numbers from 1 to 15. If you are asked to guess which number is the right number, you could guess each number starting from 1 all the way to 15. 

  This would be called a linear search.

  - linear search: a list is traversd and each element in the list is matched with the element whose location needs to be found

  * Linear Search:
    - simplest search algorithm
    - aka sequential search algorithm


### Binary Search
What if the computer told you if your guess was higher or lower?

You could then guess more efficiently. 

This approach is called a binary search, and no matter which number from 1 to 15 was selected, you should be able to find the number in 4 guesses at most.
