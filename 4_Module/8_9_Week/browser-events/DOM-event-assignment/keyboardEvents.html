<!-- Open this HTML in your browser and type in the textarea while
looking at the dev tools. Answer these questions:

1. When your cursor is in the textarea and you press the SHIFT key,
what events get triggered? Is keypress one of them? Why/why not?

  Keydown and keyup events are triggered. Shift does not produce a
  printable character so the keypress event doesn't fire.
  
  Instead, the keydown event fires to indicate that a key has been
  pressed down, and the keyup fires when the key is released.



2. What's the difference between keydown and keypress?

  * keydown: 
    - fired when a key is initially pressed down.
    - captures all keys, incl. non-printable keys like SHIFT, CTRL,
      arrow keys, etc.

  * keypress: 
    - fired after the keydown and before keyup, when a key
  that produces a character value is pressed down.
    - only triggered for keys that produce a character value like
    numbers, lettes, punctuation, etc.



3. If you hold down SHIFT and press A key, what event fires? 
Did everything happen in the order you expected?

  - keydown (SHIFT): fired first when SHIFT is pressed down
  - NO keypress: Not fired for SHIFT b/c it is a non-character key

  - keydown (A): Fired when A key is pressed down
  - keypress (A): Fired for A key, indicating the character "A"

  - keyup (A): Fired when A is released
  - keyup (SHIFT): Fired when SHIFT is released



4. How do keyboard event objects differ from each other? (For ex: how
is the event object different when pressing the A key by itself vs.
pressing it with the SHIFT pressed down as well?)

  - Keypress occurs for A but not for SHIFT b/c keypress doesn't trigger
  for non-character keys.


5. With some text already in the box, press DELETE key to delete a
character; do you expect the events to be the same or different from
the examples above?

  - keydown: Fired when the DELETE key is pressed down.
  - keypress (NO): Typically not fired for the DELETE key.
  - keyup: Fired when the DELETE key is released.


6. What happens if you add 2 identical event listeners? Does JS complain
or does it run the callback functions in both event listeners?

  It runs the callback function in both event listeners.
