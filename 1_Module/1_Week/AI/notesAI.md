* ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)


Opening Reflection:

1. What questions do you have about AI?
  - What are the main benefits of using AI vs a human?
  - What are the main draw backs of using AI vs a human?
  - How could AI help change, or improve software development?
  - Are AI's as smart as humans yet?

2. How would you like to measure your learning progress about AI?
  - Answering the above questions.
  - Knowing the definition of AI.
  - Being able to explain how it is useful and what the draw backs of using it are.


** WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

  Artificial Intelligence (AI):

  The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.


** WHAT ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF AI THAT YOU MAY HAVE EXPERIENCED?

  - virtual assistancts such as Siri 
  - chatbots incluing chatGPT and LarryAI bot (Lighthouse Labs robochat)
  - social media advertising
  - navigation apps


** WHEN WAS AI FIRST SPOKEN ABOUT IN THE COMPUTER SCIENCE WORLD?

  - 1956: John McCarthy & Marvin Minsky 



** WHAT THREE ABILITIES MAKE SOMETHING ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT?

  1. Generalized Learning
  2. Reasoning
  3. Problem Solving


** WHAT IS WEAK AI? WHAT IS STRONG AI?

  Weak AI: programmed to do only one task.

  Strong AI: self aware, only currently exists in fiction.



** AI USES MACHING LEARNING, HOW DOES MACHINE LEARNING WORK?

  Machine learning provides a machine with the capability to learn from data and experience through the use of algorithms. 


*** WHAT IS THE POINT OF SINGULARITY?

  - The point when we have robots that are as smart as humans. 


*** WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS OF AI?

  - We give them a fixed objective and we have to specify everything in the objective. 


*** WHAT KEEPS US IN CONTROL OF AI?

  - Control comes from the machines uncertainty of the true objective.


*** CONS OF AI:

  - Technological Unemployement (AI replacing humans in jobs)
  - Algorithmic bias (bias formed by the algorithms in the AI)


*** WHAT IS MACHINE LEARNING:

  Machine learning is when a machine looks for predictions based upon data it has.

  The machine "learns" rather than needs to be programmed.


*** WHAT TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING ARE THERE?

  - Supervised: 
    Has more human oversight, using labels that are super imposed on the data.  
  
  - Unsupervised:
    Able to find things that are not specifically stated.

  - Deep Learning:
    Involves neural networks involving nodes and sophisticated relationships between these nodes. 



*** BIAS'S IN AI:

Biased Training Data:
 AI models are typically trained on large datasets. If these datasets contain societal biases or incomplete information, AI models might learn and perpetuate those biases.

Data Imbalance: 
 Sometimes, the AI is trained using sets of data that don't have equal representation for all groups.

Algorithm Design: 
 The algorithms used in AI systems may inadvertently introduce bias based on their design. For example, an algorithm suggesting things to watch online might always prioritize popular content, which can amplify the existing biases and filter bubbles.

Human Involvement: 
 Humans play a crucial role in developing and fine-tuning AI systems. Biases can be introduced at various stages, like when collecting data, setting up the rules, or deciding what's important.

Feedback Loops: 
 AI systems that interact with users can learn from user behavior. If user interactions reflect biases (e.g., clicking on biased content), the AI can reinforce those biases over time.

Lack of Regulation:
 In some cases, AI development may occur without enough regulation to prevent bias. This can lead to the deployment of biased AI systems with harmful consequences.

Contextual Bias: 
 AI systems may not account for the full context of a decision. For example, an AI system might fail to consider socioeconomic factors that influence an individual's creditworthiness.
