The Troubleshooting Guide:

Before you call yourself stuck, ask yourself, have I:

- Pseudo-coded the solution?

- Googled the error message I am getting?

- Actually READ the error message?

- Double-checked my syntax?

- Linted my code?

- Pair programmed or gotten a peer to code review?

- Rubber-ducked the problem?


If all the answers to these questions is yes, then you have done your due dilligence and should be asking a mentor.
