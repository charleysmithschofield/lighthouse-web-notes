# Summary

Data structures allow us to organize our data so that it may be managed more efficiently for the problem at hand. Some data structures are built into javascript, like arrays and objects. Other data structures, like trees, we can build ourselves.

Trees are a great data structure to use when your data has hierarchical relationships. Trees allow us to use these relationships in code making the data easier to process.

We can build a tree out of anything as long as the nodes have a single parent and many children.
