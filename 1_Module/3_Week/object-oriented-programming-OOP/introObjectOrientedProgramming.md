# Introduction to Object Oriented Programming

## What the Heck is Object Oriented Orientation (OO):

  Object Orientation, commonly abbreviated "OO", is probably the biggest concept in software development philosophy of the last 30 years.

  Some of the most popular languages today like Ruby, Java and C# have been designed mainly for Object Oriented Programming, or "OOP".

  Over the last few weeks we've seen a numebr of ways to organize and improve our code. We've split big functions up into smaller functions to make our code more modular and avoid repetition.

  In these wayrs, we've tried to reduce duplicated code and encourage modularity, which means breaking cod eup into sensibly-divided units. This is a huge part of the point of object orientation, it gives us a plan for modularity.


  When we program in an object oriented way, we use objects to keep our code modular and reduce repetition.


## A Brief History of OO:

  It originated in the 1960s and became popular with C++ in the 1990s.


## Some OO Languages:
  C++
  C#
  Java
  Python
  Ruby
  PHP
  Swift
  Objective-C

## Other Languages that Chose to Use Functional Programming (FP):

  - Erlang
  - Common Lisp
  - Elixir
  - Haskell
  - Clojure


  Given the apparent popularity and adoption of the OO languages, you can appreciate that you're much more likely to work with software and developers that use OO


## Is JavaScript "OO"?

  JS has multiple paradigms, it initially popularized Functional Programming, but was also object-oriented. 

  With ES6 however, JS brought in more OOP features, further enhancing the language.

  Having multiple paradigms makes a language more flexible/powerful, but it also tends to cause confusion. In using JS to learn OOP we ahve the benefit of learning OOP in an evolutionary way that most other languages don't support.

## Conclusion
  - OO is a software development paradigm
  - OO is a popular way to solve code organization, re-use and modularity
  - OO is very important to learn due to its popularity
  - JavaScript is not strictly OO in the way that Java or Ruby are
  - Functional Programming is an alternative paradigm, and one that JavaScript also encourages
