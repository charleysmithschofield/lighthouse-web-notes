# Structured Query Language (SQL)

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language used to interact with relational databases. It is quite different from languages like JS, b/c of its declaritive nature.

It used to describe "what" you want done, rather than "how" to do soemthing.

We will be using SQL to tell the database wheat info we want and the Database Management System (DBMS) will determine the best way to provide it.
