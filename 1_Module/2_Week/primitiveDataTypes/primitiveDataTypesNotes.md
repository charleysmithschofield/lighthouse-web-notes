PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES - NOTES


* IMPORTANT NOTE:

It is important to know there are six primitive data types in Javascript.

The other details are too specific to the Javascript language. There is a 
stretch reading later that dives deeper into the JS-specific aspects of this
topic.



** In JS, all values which are NOT objects are collectively referred to as primitives **


The Six Primitive Types in Javascript

1. undefined
2. null
3. boolean
4. string
5. number
6. symbol (introduces in ES6 & not something we will focus on right now)


Primitives are essential building blocks of data b/c they represent the
simplest possible type of data that our software can have. 



OBJECTS ARE NOT PRIMITIVES

Anything not on the list above (example: a Date) is an Object. Objects are
not primitive data types. 


* We have already been introduce to objects, arrays and functions. Arrays 
and functions are both technically a sub-category of objects. Why?
Objects (incl. arrays, functions and other types of objects) have proper-
ties.
