# Midterm Advice - Notes

Some of the instructors gave us some advice for the midterms randomly during lectures.

## Gary's Advice:

  * Do it in jQuery rather than EJS b/c it's easier.

  * All browser code is like Tweeter so review that if you are having trouble.

  * Review lecture #14 if needed

  * Put event listeners "on" something like .on(somethingHere)

  * Review lecture # 19 SQL from our apps (API stuff)
