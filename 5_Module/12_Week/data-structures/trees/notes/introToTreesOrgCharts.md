# Intro to Trees: Org Charts - Reading

## Learning Outcomes

  * can explain what data structures are
  * can explain what a tree is
  * can explain why trees are useful
  * can use a tree to organize data

## Goal
This activity provides a brief into to data structures, specifically focusing on the Tree Structure.

## Introduction to Data Structures
Every application we've ever written contains some sort of data. Sometimes the data in our application is simple, and by simple I mean that we store the data in a single variable.

Strings, numbers and booleans are all simple.

    let school = "Lighthouse Labs";
    let numberOfStudents = 21;
    let betterThanOtherBootcamps = true;


Sometimes we have a bit more data, groups of data, that don't just fit nicely into single variables. 

When this happens we end up grouping together the data into something like and array or an object.

    let emojis = ["ðŸ˜Ž", "ðŸ’©", "ðŸ¤—", "ðŸ˜¼", "ðŸ˜‚"];
    let bootcampStudents = {
      "ios": 7,
      "web": 21
    };


Arrays and objects are data structures that allow us to organize our data so that it may be managed more efficiently.

Arrays are great when we have a list of data, especially when that list is in some order. Objects are great when we want to be able to look up data quickly using a key. 

These are the most common data types that exist in most languages, but these are not the only data structures out there. 

In fact, there are many other data structures that exist for organizing data in different ways.

In our case, we're going to be looking at one other commonly used data structure called a Tree.
