# Big O Notation

Big O notation describes how the number of steps in an algorithm scales relative to its input.

When we describe an algorithm using Big O notation, we:

  * Only care about arbitrarily large input
  * Drop the Non-Dominant Terms
  * Drop Constants

Some of the more common Big O running times are:

  * Logarithmic O(log n)
  * Quadratic O(n^2)
  * Linear O(n)
  * Constant O(1)
