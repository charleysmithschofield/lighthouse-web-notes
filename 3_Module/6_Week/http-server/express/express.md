# Express - Assignment Info:

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. (Check out more information about Express on their website).

## Note
With Express, we can skip a lot of the boilerplate code you saw with the http module.

This is good practice for readability, as well as taking up less development time. Express is so good at this job that it has been called the “de facto standard server framework”.

Let’s get started by creating the simplest server possible.

## Tutorial:
### Install
You should already have node installed on your system. Feel free to run node -v in your terminal to check and see which version you have. If you don't have node installed, your system will tell you. If you have it, you're ready to install Express.

1. Create a folder called express and cd into it.

2. Install Express via npm. In your console, run npm install express --save.

3. Create a new file here called server.js.

### Note
Most Node programs will have either an index.js file or a server.js file. This file lives in the root directory and serves as the entry point for the app.

If you want to verify your express installation, run npm list express. This will show you which version you have installed. The versions shouldn’t matter for this tutorial, but it’s always good to know how to check on these things. Sometimes, knowing which versions of software you have installed can save you a lot of debugging time as a dev.
