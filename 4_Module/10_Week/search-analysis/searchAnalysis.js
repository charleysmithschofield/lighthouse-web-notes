// Search Analysis

/*
  Learning Outcomes:
  - can understand what binary search is
  - can identify when and why to use binary search
  - can analyze a binary search on an array of ordered elements
  - can compare time complexity for linear vs binary search
  - can determine and use worst case scenario for determining complexity
  - can understand that if the input data for an algorithm doubles in size, and the number of steps only increases by one, then the algorithm's running time is logarithmic

/* 
  Exercise:

  Write an algorithm that will find a number in an array
  of integers, returning the index of that number. We'll
  make it a function called search(array, number).

  Expected Behavior:
  1. Input Array: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
     Input Number: 5
     Output Number: 4

  2. Input Array: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
     Input Number: 1
     Output Number: 0

  3. Input Array: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
     Input Number: 7
     Output Number: 6

  4. Input Array: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
     Input Number: 11
     Output Number: null
