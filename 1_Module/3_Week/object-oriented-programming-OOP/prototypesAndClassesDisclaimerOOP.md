# OOP Part 1: Classes & Instances:


## OOP in Javascript Disclaimer:

  JS used to use another pattern known as prototypes, not classes.

  Classes were added to JS in ES6 and simply help us work with prototypes in an easier way.
  There was no concept of classes in JS prior to ES6. Older JS code is thereform more likely to use prototypes.

  * JS mimics the behaviour of class-based or classical OOP languages now.


  Classes don't add any new features to JS, it is a different syntax.

  It's worth noting that experiences JS developers are expected to understand how prototypes work, even if they may not be used in ES6.

  For beginners, it is important for now, to just known that prototypes exist and there is a gap in your understanding. We will cover them in a bit more detail later in the program, but for now just be aware of our (intentional) ignorance towards them.
