// Using Asynchronous Functions:

/*
  Asynchronous functions are commonly used in the real world.

  Let’s take a look at an example of how you might use asynchronous functions.

  In this video, we’ll look at an example of using asynchronous functions
  for multitasking. We will be able to see that our code is still running
  while something else is happening.

// No Notes taken, too complex of a code to type out so just watch the video.


/*
  Other examples of how asynchronous functions might be used include:

  Making a network API request
  Connecting to a chat server
  Anything that takes time and where we want users to know that the code is still running, like showing a basic loading animation
